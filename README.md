# Hacklohoma Blockchain Project

Dead Man’s Contract – A tamper-proof, self-executing decentralized will! Built on Ethereum, it automates inheritance with smart contracts—no courts, no fraud, no lost wills.

## Overview

Based on the file structure, this project likely includes:

*   **Frontend:** A user interface built with React.
*   **Backend:**  The server-side logic with Node.js.
*   **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, potentially including contracts named `MultiWillContract.sol`.


## Technologies Used

*   React
*   Node.js
*   Nodemailer
*   Primereact
*   HTML/CSS
*   Solidity

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following main directories and files:

*   `/Backend`:  Contains the backend code.
*   `/Frontend`: Contains the frontend code.
*   `MultiWillContract.sol`: A Solidity smart contract.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and run the project are needed.  Typically, this would involve:

1.  **Cloning the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/venu630/Hacklohoma_Blockchain_Project.git
    cd Hacklohoma_Blockchain_Project
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:** (Example - assumes Node.js)
    ```
    cd Backend
    npm install  
    npm start    # or yarn start
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:** (Example - assumes standard web setup)
    ```
    cd Frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    npm run dev  # or yarn start (or open index.html)
    ```

4.  **Smart Contract Deployment:**

    *   Details on deploying the Solidity contracts ( `MultiWillContract.sol`) to a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) are required.  This usually involves using tools like `remix`.
